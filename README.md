# Pacparser-for-Mac

# Modified Apple packaging script from original package to bypass Apple PackageMaker, which was deprecated in Xcode 4.6, to now prepare the package and then install the library to / for use with Terminal.  The modified script has been renamed to installmac.sh.  Xcode is still leveraged for Makefile.

# Everything else remains as originally published.
